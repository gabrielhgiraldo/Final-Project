Video Game Metasearch Engine

This metasearch engine searches across Rock30Games.com, GameStop.com, and Ebay.com to
find the lowest prices for every video game, for any console.

How to Run:

1) install a local apache server (we used xampp for windows)
2) store videoGameShopper.cgi and config.txt in the appropriate directory (in our case it is in the C:\xampp\htdocs\perl)
3) run xampp and turn on the apache server
4) navigate to localhost\perl\videoGameShopper.cgi in your preffered browser
5) enter the name of the video game you're searching for in the search box
6) hit the 'search' button!
7) enjoy your games!
